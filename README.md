# 19/01/2022 main1.py update: 
### modified parking space, stop distence of the font/back/right senser
### add function: Stop while it is turnning back in the parking space

# 16/01/2022 main1.py update: 
### fix up some detial problems
### more realiable


# 12/01/2022 main1.py update: 
### Reverse side and reverse into storage.
### The path following is complete.
### Complete obstacle avoidance.
### Complete identification of parking Spaces.

### Lego-ev3-self-parking-robot
Status: Currently in phase 2 of the Lego project.
Objective: To identify obstacles, detect whether the space meets the parking conditions, and automatically stop.
#### Problem 1: 
Unable to run programs using liBS inside lego robots.
#### Problem 2: 
The mechanical structure is not firm enough, and it needs to be strengthened, especially the front wheel steering is loose.
### Problem 3: 
Using the lib inside the Lego robot can achieve the goal, but the code needs to be rebuilt. It can now automatically recognize space and reverse into storage, but the mechanical structure limits steering.

### Resolved:
#### 1. Control the sensor to measure the distance between obstacles.
#### 2. Identify space length.
