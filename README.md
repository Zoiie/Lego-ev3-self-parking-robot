# Lego-ev3-self-parking-robot
Status: Currently in phase 2 of the Lego project.
Objective: To identify obstacles, detect whether the space meets the parking conditions, and automatically stop.
## Problem 1: 
Unable to run programs using liBS inside lego robots.
## Problem 2: 
The mechanical structure is not firm enough, and it needs to be strengthened, especially the front wheel steering is loose.
## Problem 3: 
Using the lib inside the Lego robot can achieve the goal, but the code needs to be rebuilt. It can now automatically recognize space and reverse into storage, but the mechanical structure limits steering.

***Resolved:
***1. Control the sensor to measure the distance between obstacles.
***2. Identify space length.
